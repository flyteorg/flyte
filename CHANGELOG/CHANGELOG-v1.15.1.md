- Dynamic Pod Configuration: Improved merging of Ray head/worker node pod templates ([#6232](https://github.com/flyteorg/flyte/pull/6232)) and resource limits for Kubernetes plugins (Dask, Kubeflow) (#[6264](https://github.com/flyteorg/flyte/pull/6264)).

- Array Node Improvements: Added support for bound inputs ([#6276](https://github.com/flyteorg/flyte/pull/6276)) and preemption handling ([#6259](https://github.com/flyteorg/flyte/pull/6259)).

- Agent Enhancements: Added structured logging for agents ([#6344](https://github.com/flyteorg/flyte/pull/6344)) and reserved fields in execution payloads ([#6321](https://github.com/flyteorg/flyte/pull/6321)).

- Connector Plugin: Introduced a new Connector plugin framework for extensibility ([#6332](https://github.com/flyteorg/flyte/pull/6332)).

## Bug Fixes
- Error Handling: Fixed critical errors in delete operations ([#6269](https://github.com/flyteorg/flyte/pull/6269)), array node metrics ([#6291](https://github.com/flyteorg/flyte/pull/6291)), and fastcache handling for failed nodes ([#6318](https://github.com/flyteorg/flyte/pull/6318)).

- Dynamic Log Links: Enabled dynamic log links for Kubeflow plugins to improve debugging ([#6284](https://github.com/flyteorg/flyte/pull/6284)).

- Preemption Handling: Addressed edge cases in pod preemption logic for worker nodes ([#6259](https://github.com/flyteorg/flyte/pull/6259)).

## Security Patches

- Updated dependencies to address CVEs (e.g., glog ([#6301](https://github.com/flyteorg/flyte/pull/6301)), go-jose ([#6281](https://github.com/flyteorg/flyte/pull/6281)), jwt ([#6361](https://github.com/flyteorg/flyte/pull/6361), [#6365](https://github.com/flyteorg/flyte/pull/6365))).

## Documentation Updates
- Streaming Decks: Added documentation for streaming deck visualization in Flyte fundamentals ([#6251](https://github.com/flyteorg/flyte/pull/6251), [#6272](https://github.com/flyteorg/flyte/pull/6272)).

- Slurm GPU Clusters: New guides for setting up Slurm agent ([#6231](https://github.com/flyteorg/flyte/pull/6231)) and GPU clusters ([#6273](https://github.com/flyteorg/flyte/pull/6273)).

- Dynamic Log Links: Documented usage for Kubernetes-based task plugins ([#6285](https://github.com/flyteorg/flyte/pull/6285)).

- Launch Plan Chaining: Explained how to chain launch plans effectively ([#6317](https://github.com/flyteorg/flyte/pull/6317)).

## Other Improvements & Maintenance

- CI/CD: Aligned Go versions in CI with go.mod ([#5736](https://github.com/flyteorg/flyte/pull/5736)), removed mockery fork ([#6280](https://github.com/flyteorg/flyte/pull/6280), [#6288](https://github.com/flyteorg/flyte/pull/6288)), and improved codecov reporting ([#6299](https://github.com/flyteorg/flyte/pull/6064)).

## Contributor Experience
