# Deploy Flyte using one of the given overlays

To start a deployment use one of the following overlays as a starting point. If you are just playing around with Flyte, use Sandbox overlay - and preferably the pre-generated yaml - available
[here](../../deployment/sandbox/flyte_generated.yaml)

1. [Sandbox](./sandbox) : A pre-configured overlay to deploy a complete standalone cluster onto a local k8s cluster
1. [GCP](./gcp): An almost configured overlay to deploy a production ready cluster to GCP. Some modifications needed for your environment
1. [EKS](./eks): An almost configured overlay to deploy a production ready cluster to AWS. Some modifications needed for your environment
