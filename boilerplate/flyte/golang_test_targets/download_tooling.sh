# Everything in this file needs to be installed outside of current module
# The reason we cannot turn off module entirely and install is that we need the replace statement in go.mod
# because we are installing a mockery fork. Turning it off would result installing the original not the fork.
# We also want to version all the other tools.  We also want to be able to run go mod tidy without removing the version
# pins.  To facilitate this, we're maintaining two sets of go.mod/sum files - the second one only for tooling.  This is
# the same approach that go 1.14 will take as well.
