// The size of the cache is dependent on the id size and the initialization. It may also vary based on the implementation
// For example an LRU cache, may have an overhead because of the use of a HashMap with loading factor and collision
// resolution
// The Data-structure is thread-safe and can be accessed by multiple threads concurrently.
