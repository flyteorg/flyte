// A Plugin Handle method returns a Transition. This transition indicates to the Flyte framework that if the plugin wants to continue "Handle"ing this task,

// provided information in the Console/cli etc
// The information to be published is in the PhaseInfo structure. Transition Type indicates the type of consistency for subsequent handle calls in case the phase info results in a non terminal state.
// the PhaseInfo structure is very important and is used to record events in Admin. Only if the Phase + PhaseVersion was not previously observed, will an event be published to Admin
// there are only a configurable number of phase-versions usable. Usually it is preferred to be a monotonically increasing sequence
