                      description: "A Time represents an instant in time with nanosecond
                        precision. \n Programs using times should typically store
                        and pass them as values, not pointers. That is, time variables
                        and struct fields should be of type time.Time, not *time.Time.
                        \n A Time value can be used by multiple goroutines simultaneously
                        except that the methods GobDecode, UnmarshalBinary, UnmarshalJSON
                        and UnmarshalText are not concurrency-safe. \n Time instants
                        can be compared using the Before, After, and Equal methods.
                        The Sub method subtracts two instants, producing a Duration.
                        The Add method adds a Time and a Duration, producing a Time.
                        \n The zero value of type Time is January 1, year 1, 00:00:00.000000000
                        UTC. As this time is unlikely to come up in practice, the
                        IsZero method gives a simple way of detecting a time that
                        has not been initialized explicitly. \n Each Time has associated
                        with it a Location, consulted when computing the presentation
                        form of the time, such as in the Format, Hour, and Year methods.
                        The methods Local, UTC, and In return a Time with a specific
                        location. Changing the location in this way changes only the
                        presentation; it does not change the instant in time being
                        denoted and therefore does not affect the computations described
                        in earlier paragraphs. \n Representations of a Time value
                        saved by the GobEncode, MarshalBinary, MarshalJSON, and MarshalText
                        methods store the Time.Location's offset, but not the location
                        name. They therefore lose information about Daylight Saving
                        Time. \n In addition to the required “wall clock” reading,
                        a Time may contain an optional reading of the current process's
                        monotonic clock, to provide additional precision for comparison
                        or subtraction. See the “Monotonic Clocks” section in the
                        package documentation for details. \n Note that the Go ==
                        operator compares not just the time instant but also the Location
                        and the monotonic clock reading. Therefore, Time values should
                        not be used as map or database keys without first guaranteeing
                        that the identical Location has been set for all values, which
                        can be achieved through use of the UTC or Local method, and
                        that the monotonic clock reading has been stripped by setting
                        t = t.Round(0). In general, prefer t.Equal(u) to t == u, since
                        t.Equal uses the most accurate comparison available and correctly
                        handles the case when only one of its arguments has a monotonic
                        clock reading."
