Flyte provides multiple ways of creating, registering, and inspecting Flyte backend
entities. The main entities include Flyte tasks, workflows, launchplans, as well as
their associated execution entities (for more details, see :ref:`divedeep`). This section
of the user guide covers the different ways that you can programmatically control these
entities to perform operations like registering tasks, workflows, and launchplans, or
inspecting and debugging tasks/workflows that are running on a remote backend.
