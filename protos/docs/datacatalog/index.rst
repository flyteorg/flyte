Flyte Data Catalog Service
=================================

These protos provide the interface definition for the Data Catalog Service. Data Catalog is a service for
indexing parameterized, strongly-typed data artifacts across revisions. It is used in the Flyte ecosystem
to catalog artifacts generated by task executions. Outputs generated by a task can be stored as artifact
data and tagged by the user so that it can be retrieved later by that tag.
