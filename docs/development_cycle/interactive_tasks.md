# Interactive tasks

With interactive tasks you can inspect and debug live task code directly in the Union console in an embedded Visual Studio Code IDE.

## Enabling interactive tasks in your code

To enable interactive tasks, you need to:

* Include `flytekitplugins-flyteinteractive` as a dependency
* Use the `@vscode` decorator on the tasks you want to make interactive.

The `@vscode` decorator, when applied, converts a task into a Visual Studio Code server during runtime.
This process overrides the standard execution of the task’s function body, initiating a command to start a Visual Studio Code server instead.

:::{admonition} No need for ingress or port forwarding

The Union interactive tasks feature is an adaptation of the open-source [FlyteInteractive plugin](https://docs.flyte.org/en/latest/flytesnacks/examples/flyteinteractive_plugin/index.html).
It improves on the open-source version by removing the need for ingress configuration or port forwarding, providing a more seamless debugging experience.

:::

## Basic example

The following example demonstrates interactive tasks in a simple workflow.

### requirements.txt

This `requirements.txt` file is used by all the examples in this section:

```{code-block} text
flytekit
flytekitplugins-envd
flytekitplugins-flyteinteractive
```

### example.py

```{code-block} python
"""Union workflow example of interactive tasks (@vscode)"""

from flytekit import task, workflow, ImageSpec
from flytekitplugins.flyteinteractive import vscode

image = ImageSpec(
   registry="<my-image-registry>",
   name="interactive-tasks-example",
   base_image="ghcr.io/flyteorg/flytekit:py3.11-latest",
   requirements="requirements.txt"
)

@task(container_image=image)
@vscode
def say_hello(name: str) -> str:
   s = f"Hello, {name}!"
   return s

@workflow
def wf(name: str = "world") -> str:
   greeting = say_hello(name=name)
   return greeting
```

## Register and run the workflow

To register the code to a project on Union and run the workflow, follow the directions in
[Registering and running workflows](../getting-started/deploying-the-project-on-union)

## Access the IDE

1. Select the first task in the workflow page (in this example the task is called `say_hello`).
   The task info pane will appear on the right side of the page.
2. Wait until the task is in the **Running** state and the **VSCode (User)** link appears.
3. Click the **VSCode (User)** link.

## Inspect the task code

Once the IDE opens, you will be able to see your task code in the editor.

## Interactive debugging

To run the task in VSCode, click the *Run and debug* symbol on the left rail of the IDE and select the **Interactive Debugging** configuration.

![](/_static/images/interactive-debugging.png)

Click the **Play** button beside the configuration drop-down to run the task.
This will run your task with inputs from the previous task. To inspect intermediate states, set breakpoints in the Python code and use the debugger for tracing.

:::{admonition} No task output written to Union storage

It’s important to note that during the debugging phase the task runs entirely within VSCode and does not write the output to Union storage.

:::

## Update your code

You can edit your code in the VSCode environment and run the task again to see the changes.
Note, however, that the changes will not be automatically persisted anywhere.
You will have to manually copy and paste the changes back to your local environment.

## Resume task

After you finish debugging, you can resume your task with updated code by executing the **Resume Task** configuration.
This will terminate the code server, run the task with inputs from the previous task, and write the output to Union storage.

:::{admonition} Remember to persist your code

Remember to persist your code (for example, by checking it into GitHub) before resuming the task, since you will lose the connection to the VSCode server afterwards.

## Auxiliary Python files

You will notice that aside from your code, there are some additional files in the VSCode file explorer that have been automatically generated by the system:

### flyteinteractive_interactive_entrypoint.py

The `flyteinteractive_interactive_entrypoint.py` script implements the **Interactive Debugging** action that we used above:

![](/_static/images/flyteinteractive-interactive-entrypoint-py.png)

### flyteinteractive_resume_task.py

The `flyteinteractive_resume_task.py` script implements the **Resume Task** action that we used above:

![](/_static/images/flyteinteractive-resume-task-py.png)

### launch.json

The `launch.json` file in the `.vscode` directory configures the **Interactive Debugging** and **Resume Task** actions.

![](/_static/images/launch-json.png)

## Integrated terminal

In addition to using the convenience functions defined by the auxiliary files, you can also run your Python code script directly from the integrated terminal using `python <script_name>.py` (in this example, `python hello.py`).

## Install extensions

As with local VSCode, you can install a variety of extensions to assist development.
Available extensions differ from official VSCode for legal reasons and are hosted on the [Open VSX Registry](https://open-vsx.org/).

Python and Jupyter extensions are installed by default.
Additional extensions can be added by defining a configuration object and passing it to the `@vscode` decorator, as shown below:

### example-extensions.py

```{code-block} python
"""Union workflow example of interactive tasks (@vscode) with extensions"""

from flytekit import task, workflow, ImageSpec
from flytekitplugins.flyteinteractive import COPILOT_EXTENSION, VscodeConfig, vscode

image = ImageSpec(
   registry="<my-image-registry>",
   name="interactive-tasks-example",
   base_image="ghcr.io/flyteorg/flytekit:py3.11-latest",
   requirements="requirements.txt"
)

config = VscodeConfig()
config.add_extensions(COPILOT_EXTENSION)  # Use predefined URL
config.add_extensions(
    "https://open-vsx.org/api/vscodevim/vim/1.27.0/file/vscodevim.vim-1.27.0.vsix"
)  # Copy raw URL from Open VSX

@task(container_image=image)
@vscode(config=config)
def say_hello(name: str) -> str:
   s = f"Hello, {name}!"
   return s

@workflow
def wf(name: str = "world") -> str:
   greeting = say_hello(name=name)
   return greeting
```

## Manage resources

To manage resources, the VSCode server is terminated after a period of idleness (no active HTTP connections).
Idleness is monitored via a heartbeat file.

The `max_idle_seconds` parameter can be used to set the maximum number of seconds the VSCode server can be idle before it is terminated.

### example-manage-resources.py

```{code-block} python
"""Union workflow example of interactive tasks (@vscode) with max_idle_seconds"""

from flytekit import task, workflow, ImageSpec
from flytekitplugins.flyteinteractive import vscode

image = ImageSpec(
   registry="<my-image-registry>",
   name="interactive-tasks-example",
   base_image="ghcr.io/flyteorg/flytekit:py3.11-latest",
   requirements="requirements.txt"
)

@task(container_image=image)
@vscode(max_idle_seconds=60000)
def say_hello(name: str) -> str:
   s = f"Hello, {name}!"
   return s

@workflow
def wf(name: str = "world") -> str:
   greeting = say_hello(name=name)
   return greeting
```

## Pre and post hooks

Interactive tasks also allow the registration of functions to be executed both before and after VSCode starts.
This can be used for tasks requiring setup or cleanup.

### example-pre-post-hooks.py

```{code-block} python
"""Union workflow example of interactive tasks (@vscode) with pre and post hooks"""

from flytekit import task, workflow, ImageSpec
from flytekitplugins.flyteinteractive import vscode

image = ImageSpec(
   registry="<my-image-registry>",
   name="interactive-tasks-example",
   base_image="ghcr.io/flyteorg/flytekit:py3.11-latest",
   requirements="requirements.txt"
)

def set_up_proxy():
    print("set up")

def push_code():
    print("push code")

@task(container_image=image)
@vscode(pre_execute=set_up_proxy, post_execute=push_code)
def say_hello(name: str) -> str:
   s = f"Hello, {name}!"
   return s

@workflow
def wf(name: str = "world") -> str:
   greeting = say_hello(name=name)
   return greeting
```

## Only initiate VSCode on task failure

The system can also be set to only initiate VSCode *after a task failure*, preventing task termination and thus enabling inspection.
This is done by setting the `run_task_first` parameter to `True`.

### example-run-task-first.py

```{code-block} python
"""Union workflow example of interactive tasks (@vscode) with run_task_first"""

from flytekit import task, workflow, ImageSpec
from flytekitplugins.flyteinteractive import vscode

image = ImageSpec(
   registry="<my-image-registry>",
   name="interactive-tasks-example",
   base_image="ghcr.io/flyteorg/flytekit:py3.11-latest",
   requirements="requirements.txt"
)

@task(container_image=image)
@vscode(run_task_first=True)
def say_hello(name: str) -> str:
   s = f"Hello, {name}!"
   return s

@workflow
def wf(name: str = "world") -> str:
   greeting = say_hello(name=name)
   return greeting
```
