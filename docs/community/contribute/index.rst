Thank you for taking the time to contribute to Flyte!

Here are some guidelines for you to follow, which will make your first and follow-up contributions easier.

TL;DR: Find the repo-specific contribution guidelines in the :ref:`Component Reference <component_reference>` section.

üíª Becoming a contributor
=========================

An issue tagged with `good first issue <https://github.com/flyteorg/flyte/labels/good%20first%20issue>`__ is the best place to start for first-time contributors.

**Fork and clone the concerned repository. Create a new branch on your fork and make the required changes. Create a pull request once your work is ready for review.**

.. note::
    To open a pull request, refer to `GitHub's guide <https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/>`__ for detailed instructions.

Example PR for your reference: `GitHub PR <https://github.com/flyteorg/flytepropeller/pull/242>`__.
Several checks are introduced to help maintain the robustness of the project:

#. To get through DCO, sign off on every commit (`Reference <https://github.com/src-d/guide/blob/master/developer-community/fix-DCO.md>`__)
#. To improve code coverage, write unit tests to test your code.
#. Make sure all the tests pass. If you face any issues, please let us know in the `#contribute <https://flyte-org.slack.com/archives/C04NJPLRWUX>`__ channel
#. Format your Go code with ``golangci-lint`` followed by ``goimports`` (use ``make lint`` and ``make goimports``)
#. Format your Python code with ``black`` and ``isort`` (use ``make fmt``).
#. If make targets are not available, you can manually format the code.

.. note::
    Refer to `Effective Go <https://golang.org/doc/effective_go>`__, `Black <https://github.com/psf/black>`__, and `Isort <https://github.com/PyCQA/isort>`__ for full coding standards.

As you become more involved with the project, you may be able to be added as a committer to the repos you're working on. Checkout the `Flyte Contributor Ladder <https://github.com/flyteorg/community/blob/main/GOVERNANCE.md#community-roles-and-path-to-maintainership>`__ to learn more.
