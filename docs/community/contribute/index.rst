Thank you for taking the time to contribute to Flyte!
Please read our `Code of Conduct <https://lfprojects.org/policies/code-of-conduct/>`__ before contributing to Flyte.

Here are some guidelines for you to follow, which will make your first and follow-up contributions easier.

TL;DR: Find the repo-specific contribution guidelines in the :ref:`Component Reference <component_reference>` section.

üíª Becoming a contributor
=========================

An issue tagged with `good first issue <https://github.com/flyteorg/flyte/labels/good%20first%20issue>`__ is the best place to start for first-time contributors.

**Appetizer for every repo: Fork and clone the concerned repository. Create a new branch on your fork and make the required changes. Create a pull request once your work is ready for review.**

.. note::
    To open a pull request, refer to `GitHub's guide <https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/>`__ for detailed instructions.

Example PR for your reference: `GitHub PR <https://github.com/flyteorg/flytepropeller/pull/242>`__.
A couple of checks are introduced to help maintain the robustness of the project.

#. To get through DCO, sign off on every commit (`Reference <https://github.com/src-d/guide/blob/master/developer-community/fix-DCO.md>`__)
#. To improve code coverage, write unit tests to test your code
#. Make sure all the tests pass. If you face any issues, please let us know

On a side note, format your Go code with ``golangci-lint`` followed by ``goimports`` (use ``make lint`` and ``make goimports``), and Python code with ``black`` and ``isort`` (use ``make fmt``).
If make targets are not available, you can manually format the code.
Refer to `Effective Go <https://golang.org/doc/effective_go>`__, `Black <https://github.com/psf/black>`__, and `Isort <https://github.com/PyCQA/isort>`__ for full coding standards.

As you become more involved with the project, you may be able to be added as a contributor to the repos you're working on,
but there is a medium term effort to move all development to forks.

üêû File an issue
================

We use `GitHub Issues <https://github.com/flyteorg/flyte/issues>`__ for issue tracking. The following issue types are available for filing an issue:

* `Plugin Request <https://github.com/flyteorg/flyte/issues/new?assignees=&labels=untriaged%2Cplugins&template=backend-plugin-request.md&title=%5BPlugin%5D>`__
* `Bug Report <https://github.com/flyteorg/flyte/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug%2C+untriaged&template=bug_report.md&title=%5BBUG%5D+>`__
* `Documentation Bug/Update Request <https://github.com/flyteorg/flyte/issues/new?assignees=&labels=documentation%2C+untriaged&template=docs_issue.md&title=%5BDocs%5D>`__
* `Core Feature Request <https://github.com/flyteorg/flyte/issues/new?assignees=&labels=enhancement%2C+untriaged&template=feature_request.md&title=%5BCore+Feature%5D>`__
* `Flytectl Feature Request <https://github.com/flyteorg/flyte/issues/new?assignees=&labels=enhancement%2C+untriaged%2C+flytectl&template=flytectl_issue.md&title=%5BFlytectl+Feature%5D>`__
* `Housekeeping <https://github.com/flyteorg/flyte/issues/new?assignees=&labels=housekeeping&template=housekeeping_template.md&title=%5BHousekeeping%5D+>`__
* `UI Feature Request <https://github.com/flyteorg/flyte/issues/new?assignees=&labels=enhancement%2C+untriaged%2C+ui&template=ui_feature_request.md&title=%5BUI+Feature%5D>`__

If none of the above fit your requirements, file a `blank <https://github.com/flyteorg/flyte/issues/new>`__ issue.
Also, add relevant labels to your issue. For example, if you are filing a Flytekit plugin request, add the ``flytekit`` label.

For feedback at any point in the contribution process, feel free to reach out to us on `Slack <https://slack.flyte.org/>`__.
