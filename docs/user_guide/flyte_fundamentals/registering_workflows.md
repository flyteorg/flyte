# Registering workflows

In this guide, you'll learn how to package and register (that is, deploy) your tasks and
workflows to a Flyte cluster. This will enable you to scale your workloads with
larger memory and compute requirements, schedule your workflows to run on a
pre-defined cadence, and leverage the Flyte backend plugins like Spark.

```{admonition} Prerequisites
:class: important

This guide assumes that you:

- Have a local Flyte cluster running with `flytectl demo start` as described in {ref}`"Running workflows locally" <getting_started_running_workflow_local_cluster>` guide.
- Followed the {doc}`Creating a Flyte project <../getting_started_with_workflow_development/creating_a_flyte_project>`
  guide to create a minimal Flyte project.
```

## Custom dependencies

If you have custom Python dependencies, update the `requirements.txt` file that
ships with the {ref}`project template <getting_started_python_dependencies>`
and those changes will be incorporated into the Docker image.

You can also update the Dockerfile (if using a Dockerfile) or the {ref}`ImageSpec configuration <image_spec_example>` if you want to use a different base image or if the additional Python dependencies
require installing binaries or packages from other languages.

## Registration patterns

There are different methods of registering your workflows to a Flyte cluster
where each method fulfills a particular use case during the workflow development
cycle. In this section, we'll cover the commands you need to fulfill the
following use cases:

1. Iterating on a single workflow script.
2. Iterating on a Flyte project with multiple task/workflow modules.
3. Deploying your workflows to a production environment.

The following diagram provides a summarized view of the different registration patterns:

## Iterating on a single task or workflow

The quickest way to register a task or workflow to a Flyte cluster is with the
`pyflyte run` CLI command. Assuming that you're inside the `my_project` directory
that we created in {doc}`Creating a Flyte project <../getting_started_with_workflow_development/creating_a_flyte_project>`,
you can invoke it like so:

```{prompt} bash $
pyflyte run --remote workflows/example.py wf --name "Gilgamesh"
```

````{div} shadow p-3 mb-8 rounded

**Expected Output:** A URL to the workflow execution on your demo Flyte cluster:

```{code-block}
Go to http://localhost:30080/console/projects/flytesnacks/domains/development/executions/<execution_name> to see execution in the console.
```

Where ``<execution_name>`` is a unique identifier for the workflow execution.

````

`pyflyte run` will not only register the specified workflow `wf`, it will also
run it with the supplied arguments. As you can see from the expected output, you
can visit the link to the Flyte console to see the progress of your running
execution.

You may also run `run --remote --copy all`, which is very similar to the above command. As the name suggests, this will copy the source tree rooted at the top-level `__init__.py` file. With this strategy, any modules discoverable on the `PYTHONPATH` will be importable.

```{note}
`pyflyte run` supports Flyte workflows that import any other user-defined modules that
contain additional tasks or workflows.
```

### Iterating on a Flyte project

One of Flyte's benefits is its functional design, which means that you can
import and reuse tasks and workflows like you would Python functions when you
organize your code into meaningful sets of modules and subpackages.

When you move past a single script that contains your workflows, use the
`pyflyte register` command to register all the tasks and workflows contained
in the specified directory or file:

```{prompt} bash $
pyflyte register workflows
```

````{div} shadow p-3 mb-8 rounded

**Expected Output:**

```{code-block} bash
Successfully serialized 4 flyte objects
Found and serialized 4 entities
  Registering workflows.example.say_hello....done, TASK with version sdYMF0jAkhDh_KA1IMAFYA==.
  Registering workflows.example.greeting_length....done, TASK with version sdYMF0jAkhDh_KA1IMAFYA==.
  Registering workflows.example.wf....done, WORKFLOW with version sdYMF0jAkhDh_KA1IMAFYA==.
  Registering workflows.example.wf....done, LAUNCH_PLAN with version sdYMF0jAkhDh_KA1IMAFYA==.
Successfully registered 4 entities
```

````

By default, `pyflyte register` uses a [default Docker image](https://ghcr.io/flyteorg/flytekit)
that's maintained by the Flyte team, but you can use your own Docker image by
passing in the `--image` flag.

For example, assuming that you want to use the latest Python 3.9 flytekit image,
the explicit equivalent to the default image value would be something like:

```{prompt} bash $
pyflyte register workflows --image ghcr.io/flyteorg/flytekit:py3.9-latest
```

````{note}
You can also specify multiple workflow directories, like:

```{prompt} bash $
pyflyte register <dir1> <dir2> ...
```

This is useful in cases where you want to register two different Flyte projects
that you maintain in a single place.

````

Once you've successfully registered your workflows, you can execute them by
going to the Flyte console. If you're using a local Flyte demo cluster, you can
go to the browser at `localhost:30080/console` and do the following:

- Navigate to the **flytesnacks** > **development** domain.
- Click on the **Workflows** section of the left-hand sidebar.
- Click on the **workflows.example.wf** card on the workflows list.
- Click on the **Launch Workflow** button on the top-right corner.
- Fill in an input **name** and click on the **Launch** button.

```{note}
In the next guide you'll learn about how to run your workflows programmatically.
```

#### Fast registration

`pyflyte register` packages up your code through a mechanism called
**fast registration**. Fast registration is useful when you already have a
container image that's hosted in your container registry of choice and you change
your workflow/task code _without any changes in your system-level/Python
dependencies_. At a high level, fast registration:

1. ðŸ“¦ **Packages** and zips up the directory/file that you specify as the argument to
   `pyflyte register`, along with any files in the root directory of your
   project. The result of this is a tarball that is packaged into a `.tar.gz`
   file, which also includes the serialized task (in `protobuf` format) and workflow specifications
   defined in your workflow code.
2. ðŸš¢ **Registers** the Flyte package to the specified Flyte cluster and uploads the
   tarball containing the user-defined code into the configured blob store
   (e.g. `s3`, `gcs`).

At workflow execution time, Flyte knows to automatically inject the zipped up
task/workflow code into the running container, thereby overriding the user-defined
tasks/workflows that were originally baked into the image.

```{admonition} Ignoring files during fast registration
:class: important

In step (1) of the fast registration process, by default Flyte will package up
all user-defined code at the root of your project. In some cases, your project
directory may contain datasets, model files, and other potentially large
artifacts that you want to exclude from the tarball.

You can do so by specifying these files in a `.flyteignore` file in the root
of your project. You can also use `.gitignore` or `.dockerignore` if you'd like
to avoid adding another file.
```

```{note}
`WORKDIR`, `PYTHONPATH`, and `PATH`

When executing any of the above commands, the archive that gets creates is extracted wherever the WORKDIR is set. This can be handled directly via the WORKDIR directive in a Dockerfile, or specified via `source_root` if using ImageSpec. This is important for discovering code and executables via `PATH` or `PYTHONPATH`. A common pattern for making your Python packages fully discoverable is to have a top-level `src` folder, adding that to your `PYTHONPATH`, and making all your imports absolute. This avoids having to "install" your Python project in the image at any point e.g. via `pip install -e`.
```

### Productionizing your workflows

Flyte's core design decision is to make workflows reproducible and repeatable.
One way it achieves this is by providing a way for you to bake-in user-defined
workflows and all of their dependencies into a Docker container.

The third method of registering your workflows uses two commands:

- `pyflyte package`: packages your tasks and workflows into `protobuf` format.
- `flytectl register`: registers the Flyte package to the configured cluster.

This is the production-grade registration flow that we recommend because this
method ensures that the workflows are fully containerized, which ensures that
the system- and Python-level dependencies along with your workflow source code
are immutable.

(containerizing_your_project)=

#### Containerizing your project

Flyte relies on OCI-compatible containers to package up your code and third-party
dependencies. When you invoke `pyflyte init`, the resulting template project
ships with a `docker_build.sh` script that you can use to build and tag a
container according to the recommended practice:

```{prompt} bash $
./docker_build.sh
```

```{important}
By default, the `docker_build.sh` script:

- Uses the `PROJECT_NAME` specified in the `pyflyte init` command, which in
  this case is `my_project`.
- Will not use any remote registry.
- Uses the git sha to version your tasks and workflows.
```

You can override the default values with the following flags:

```{prompt} bash $
./docker_build.sh -p <PROJECT_NAME> -r <REGISTRY> -v <VERSION>
```

For example, if you want to push your Docker image to Github's container
registry you can specify the `-r ghcr.io` flag.

```{note}
The `docker_build.sh` script is purely for convenience; you can always roll
your own way of building Docker containers.
```

Once you've built the image, you can push it to the specified registry. For
example, if you're using Github container registry, do the following:

```{prompt} bash $
docker login ghcr.io
docker push <tag>
```

```{admonition} Pulling private images
:class: important

For many projects it's convenient to make your images public, but in the case
that you're building proprietary images or images that may contain sensitive
metadata/configuration, it's more secure if they're private.

Learn more about how to pull private image in the {ref}`User Guide <private_images>`.
```

##### Relationship between ImageSpec and fast registration
The `ImageSpec` construct available in flytekit also has a mechanism to copy files into the image being built. Its behavior depends on the type of registration used:
* If fast register is used, then it's assumed that you don't also want to copy source files into the built image.
* If fast register is not used (which is the default for `pyflyte package`, or if `pyflyte register --copy none` is specified), then it's assumed that you do want source files copied into the built image.

If your `ImageSpec` constructor specifies a `source_root` and the `copy` argument is set to something other than `CopyFileDetection.NO_COPY`, then files will be copied regardless of fast registration status.

#### Package your project with `pyflyte package`

You can package your project with the `pyflyte package` command like so:

```{prompt} bash $
pyflyte --pkgs workflows package --image ghcr.io/flyteorg/flytekit:py3.9-latest
```

````{div} shadow p-3 mb-8 rounded

**Expected Output:**

```{code-block} bash
Successfully serialized 4 flyte objects
  Packaging workflows.example.say_hello -> 0_workflows.example.say_hello_1.pb
  Packaging workflows.example.greeting_length -> 1_workflows.example.greeting_length_1.pb
  Packaging workflows.example.wf -> 2_workflows.example.wf_2.pb
  Packaging workflows.example.wf -> 3_workflows.example.wf_3.pb
Successfully packaged 4 flyte objects into /Users/nielsbantilan/sandbox/my_project/flyte-package.tgz
```

````

This will create a portable package `flyte-package.tgz` containing all the Flyte
entities compiled as protobuf files that you can register with multiple Flyte
clusters.

````{note}
You can specify multiple workflow directories using the following command:

```{prompt} bash $
pyflyte --pkgs <dir1> --pkgs <dir2> package ...
```

This is useful in cases where you want to register two different Flyte projects
that you maintain in a single place.


If you encounter a ``ModuleNotFoundError`` when packaging, use the `--source` option to include the correct source paths. For instance:

```{prompt} bash $
pyflyte --pkgs <dir1> package --source ./src -f
```
````

#### Register with `flytectl register`

Finally, register your tasks and workflows with `flytectl register files`:

```{prompt} bash $
flytectl register files \
    --project flytesnacks \
    --domain development \
    --archive flyte-package.tgz \
    --version "$(git rev-parse HEAD)"
```

Let's break down what each flag is doing here:

- `--project`: A project is a Flyte concept for built-in multi-tenancy so that
  you can logically group tasks and workflows. The Flyte demo cluster ships with
  a default project called `flytesnacks`.
- `--domain`: A domain enables workflows to be executed in different environment,
  with separate resource isolation and feature configurations. The Flyte demo
  cluster ships with three default domains: `development`, `staging`, and
  `production`.
- `--archive`: This argument allows you to pass in a package file, which in
  this case is `flyte-package.tgz`.
- `--version`: This is a version string that can be any string, but we recommend
  using the git sha in general, especially in production use cases.

### Using `pyflyte register` versus `pyflyte package` + `flytectl register`

As a rule of thumb, `pyflyte register` works well in a single Flyte cluster where
you are iterating quickly on your task/workflow code.

On the other hand, `pyflyte package` and `flytectl register` is appropriate if
you're:

- Working with multiple Flyte clusters since it uses a portable package
- Deploying workflows to a production context
- Testing your Flyte workflows in your CI/CD infrastructure.

```{admonition} Programmatic Python API
:class: important

You can also perform the equivalent of the three methods of registration using
a {py:class}`~flytekit.remote.remote.FlyteRemote` object. You can learn more
about how to do this {ref}`here <flytekit:design-control-plane>`.
```

## CI/CD with Flyte and GitHub Actions

You can use any of the commands we learned in this guide to register, execute,
or test Flyte workflows in your CI/CD process. The core Flyte team maintains
two GitHub actions that facilitates this:

- [`flyte-setup-action`](https://github.com/unionai-oss/flytectl-setup-action):
  This action handles the installation of `flytectl` in your action runner.
- [`flyte-register-action`](https://github.com/unionai-oss/flyte-register-action):
  This action uses `flytectl register` under the hood to handle registration
  of Flyte packages, for example, the `.tgz` archives that are created by
  `pyflyte package`.

### Some CI/CD best practices

In case Flyte workflows are registered on each commit in your build pipelines, you can consider the following recommendations and approach:

- **Versioning Strategy** : Determining the version of the build for different types of commits makes them consistent and identifiable. For commits on feature branches, use `<branch-name>-<short-commit-hash>` and for the ones on main branches, use `main-<short-commit-hash>`. Use version numbers for the released (tagged) versions.

- **Workflow Serialization and Registration** : Workflows should be serialized and registered based on the versioning of the build and the container image. Depending on whether the build is for a feature branch or main, the registration domain should be adjusted accordingly. For more context, please visit the [Registering workflows](https://docs.flyte.org/en/latest/user_guide/flyte_fundamentals/registering_workflows.html) page.

- **Container Image Specification** : When managing multiple images across tasks within a Flyte workflow, use the `--image` flag during registration to specify which image to use. This avoids hardcoding the image within the task definition, promoting reusability and flexibility in workflows.
