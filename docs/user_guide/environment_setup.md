# Environment setup

## Prerequisites

- Make sure you have [docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [git](https://git-scm.com/) installed.
- Install {doc}`flytectl <flytectl:index>`, the commandline interface for Flyte.

## Repo setup

As we intend to execute the code locally, duplicate this code block into `hello_world.py`.

```python
from flytekit import task, workflow

@task
def say_hello() -> str:
    return "Hello, World!"

@workflow
def hello_world_wf() -> str:
    res = say_hello()
    return res

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(f"Running hello_world_wf() {hello_world_wf()}")
```

To install `flytekit`, run the following command:

```
pip install flytekit
```

:::{tip}
**Recommended**: Create a new python virtual environment to make sure it doesn't interfere with your
development environment. You can do this by running the following commands in your terminal:

```{prompt} bash
python -m venv ~/venvs/flyte-examples
source ~/venvs/flyte-examples/bin/activate
```

:::

To make sure everything is working in your virtual environment, run `hello_world.py` locally:

```{prompt} bash
python hello_world.py
```

Expected output:

```{prompt}
Running hello_world_wf() Hello, World!
```

## Create a local demo Flyte cluster

```{important}
Make sure the Docker daemon is running before starting the demo cluster.
```

Use `flytectl` to start a demo Flyte cluster:

```{prompt} bash
flytectl demo start
```

After this completes, be sure to export the Flyte config as it will be essential later. Run the command in the output that looks like this:

```{prompt} bash
export FLYTECTL_CONFIG= ~/<pathTo>/.flyte/config-sandbox.yaml
```

## Running workflows

Now you can run the example workflow locally using the default Docker image bundled with `flytekit`:

```{prompt} bash
pyflyte run hello_world.py hello_world_wf
```

:::{note}
The initial arguments of `pyflyte run` take the form of
`path/to/script.py <task_or_workflow_name>`, where `<task_or_workflow_name>`
refers to the function decorated with `@task` or `@workflow` that you wish to run.
:::

To run the workflow on the demo Flyte cluster, all you need to do is supply the `--remote` flag:

```
pyflyte run --remote hello_world.py hello_world_wf
```

You can also run the code directly from a remote source:

```
pyflyte run --remote \
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flyteorg/flytesnacks/master/example_code/basics/basics/hello_world.py \
    hello_world_wf
```

You should see an output that looks like:

```{prompt}
Go to https://<flyte_admin_url>/console/projects/flytesnacks/domains/development/executions/<execution_name> to see execution in the console.
```

You can visit this URL to inspect the execution as it runs:

:::{figure} https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flyteorg/static-resources/main/common/first_run_console.gif
:alt: A quick visual tour for launching your first Workflow.
:::

Finally, run a workflow that takes some inputs, for example the `workflow.py` example:

```{prompt} bash
pyflyte run --remote \
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flyteorg/flytesnacks/master/example_code/basics/basics/workflow.py \
    simple_wf --x '[-3,0,3]' --y '[7,4,-2]'
```

:::{note}
We're passing in the workflow inputs as additional options to `pyflyte run`. In the above example, the
inputs are `--x '[-3,0,3]'` and `--y '[7,4,-2]'`. For snake-case argument names like `arg_name`, you can provide the
option as `--arg-name`.
:::

## Visualizing workflows

Workflows can be visualized as DAGs on the UI.
However, you can visualize workflows on the browser and in the terminal by _just_ using your terminal.

To view workflow on the browser:

```{prompt} bash $
flytectl get workflows \
    --project flytesnacks \
    --domain development \
    --version <version> \
    -o doturl \
    workflow.simple_wf
```

To view workflow as a `strict digraph` on the command line:

```{prompt} bash $
flytectl get workflows \
    --project flytesnacks \
    --domain development \
    --version <version> \
    -o dot \
    workflow.simple_wf
```

Replace `<version>` with the version obtained from the console UI,
which might resemble something like `BLrGKJaYsW2ME1PaoirK1g==`.

:::{tip}
Running most of the examples in the **User guide** only requires the default Docker image that ships with Flyte.
Many examples in the {ref}`tutorials` and {ref}`integrations` section depend on additional libraries such as
`sklearn`, `pytorch` or `tensorflow`, which will not work with the default docker image used by `pyflyte run`.

These examples will explicitly show you which images to use for running these examples by passing in the Docker
image you want to use with the `--image` option in `pyflyte run`.
:::

ðŸŽ‰ Congrats! Now you can run all the examples in the {ref}`userguide` ðŸŽ‰!

## Configuring the demo cluster to use additional resources

Depending on how resource intensive your workflows are, you may encounter errors such as
OOM (Out of Memory) errors or find pods with the status OOMKilled.
It is crucial to understand that the demo cluster is not set up to immediately accommodate
all workflow requirements, and some resource requests may be ignored based on the cluster's limits.

:::{tip}
Keep in mind that, for production deployments, you should give careful consideration to
these configurations rather than simply setting large numbers.
:::

Here's how you can go about modifying the configurations:

1. Add cluster resource attributes to `cra.yaml`:

```
attributes:
    projectQuotaCpu: "1000"
    projectQuotaMemory: 5Ti
project: flytesnacks
domain: development
```

2. Add task resource attributes to `tra.yaml`:

```
defaults:
    cpu: "2"
    memory: 1Gi
limits:
    cpu: "1000"
    memory: 5Ti
project: flytesnacks
domain: development
```

3. Apply the two configuration files using the following commands:

```
$ flytectl update task-resource-attribute --attrFile tra.yaml
$ flytectl update cluster-resource-attribute --attrFile cra.yaml
```

4. Confirm that the configuration is applied using the following commands:

```
$ flytectl get task-resource-attribute -p flytesnacks -d development
{"project":"flytesnacks","domain":"development","defaults":{"cpu":"2","memory":"1Gi"},"limits":{"cpu":"1000","memory":"5Ti"}}

$ flytectl get cluster-resource-attribute -p flytesnacks -d development
{"project":"flytesnacks","domain":"development","attributes":{"projectQuotaCpu":"1000","projectQuotaMemory":"5Ti"}}
```

And that's it! You have successfully modified your Flyte demo cluster to accommodate resource intensive workloads.

For more information, refer to the
[Configuring Custom K8s Resources](https://docs.flyte.org/en/latest/deployment/configuration/general.html) guide.

## Local registry

If you find yourself using tasks dependent on `ImageSpec` containers built with `envd` on the demo cluster,
before you submit your workflow, you will need to inform `envd` how to push the images it builds to the cluster.
This can be done via:

```
pip install flytekitplugins-envd
envd context create --name flyte-sandbox --builder tcp --builder-address localhost:30003 --use
```

You will also need to update your `ImageSpec` instances to set `registry="localhost:30000"`.
