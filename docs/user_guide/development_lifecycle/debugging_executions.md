# Debugging executions

The inspection of task and workflow execution would provide you log links to debug things further

Using `--details` flag would shows you node executions view with log links.

```
└── n1 - FAILED - 2021-06-30 08:51:07.3111846 +0000 UTC - 2021-06-30 08:51:17.192852 +0000 UTC

```

Additionally you can check the pods launched by flyte in \<project>-\<domain> namespace

```
kubectl get pods -n <project>-<domain>
```

The launched pods will have a prefix of execution name along with suffix of nodeId

```
NAME                        READY   STATUS             RESTARTS   AGE
f65009af77f284e50959-n0-0   0/1     ErrImagePull       0          18h
```

So here the investigation can move ahead by describing the pod and checking the issue with Image pull.
