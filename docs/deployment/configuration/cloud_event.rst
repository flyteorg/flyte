Cloud Events

.. tags:: Infrastructure, AWS, GCP, Advanced

Progress of Flyte workflow and task execution is delimited by a series of
events that are passed from the FlytePropeller to FlyteAdmin. Administrators
can configure FlyteAdmin to send these `cloud events <https://cloudevents.io/>`_ onwards to a pub/sub system like
SNS/SQS as well. Note that this configuration is distinct from the
configuration for notifications :ref:`deployment-configuration-notifications`,
and :ref:`deployment-configuration-eventing`.
They should use separate topics/queues. These events are meant for external
consumption, outside the Flyte platform.

*********
Use cases
*********

CloudEvents is a specification for describing event data in common formats
to provide interoperability across services, platforms and systems.

The external events flow can be useful for tracking data lineage and
integrating with existing systems within your organization.

*************************
Supported Implementations
*************************

Event egress can be configured to work with **AWS** using
`SQS <https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/>`_ and
`SNS <https://aws.amazon.com/sns/>`_,
**GCP** `Cloud Pub/Sub <https://cloud.google.com/pubsub>`_, or
`Apache Kafka <https://kafka.apache.org/>`_

*************
Configuration
*************

To turn on, add the following to your FlyteAdmin:

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: AWS SNS
   
       .. code:: yaml
   
         cloud_events.yaml: |
           cloudEvents:
             enable: true
             aws:
               region: us-east-2
             eventsPublisher:
               eventTypes:
               - all # or node, task, workflow
               topicName: arn:aws:sns:us-east-2:123456:123-my-topic
             type: aws
   
   .. tab:: GCP Pub/Sub
   
       .. code:: yaml
   
         cloud_events.yaml: |
           cloudEvents:
             enable: true
             gcp:
               projectId: my-project-id
             eventsPublisher:
               eventTypes:
               - all # or node, task, workflow
               topicName: my-topic
             type: gcp
   
   .. tab:: Apache Kafka
   
       .. code:: yaml
   
         cloud_events.yaml: |
           cloudEvents:
             enable: true
             kafka:
               brokers: 127.0.0.1:9092
             eventsPublisher:
               eventTypes:
               - all
               topicName: myTopic
             type: kafka

Helm
======
There should already be a section for this in the ``values.yaml`` file. Update
the settings under the ``cloud_events`` key and turn ``enable`` to ``true``.
The same flag is used for Helm as for Admin itself.

*****
Usage
*****

The events are emitted in cloud Event format, and the data in the cloud event
will be base64 encoded binary representation of the following IDL messages:

* ``admin_event_pb2.TaskExecutionEventRequest``
* ``admin_event_pb2.NodeExecutionEventRequest``
* ``admin_event_pb2.WorkflowExecutionEventRequest``

Which of these three events is being sent can be distinguished by the subject
line of the message, which will be one of the three strings above.

Note that these message wrap the underlying event messages
:std:ref:`found here <ref_flyteidl/event/event.proto>`.

CloudEvent Spec
===============

.. code:: json

    {
        "specversion" : "1.0",
        "type" : "com.flyte.resource.workflow",
        "source" : "https://github.com/flyteorg/flyteadmin",
        "id" : "D234-1234-1234",

        "data" : "workflow execution event"
    }

.. note::
   The message format may eventually change to an enriched and distinct message type in future releases.
